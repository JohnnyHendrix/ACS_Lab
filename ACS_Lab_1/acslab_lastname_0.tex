\label{Introduction} % und ein Label
This is the solution sheet for the first Access Control Systems Lab exercise sheet. The main intention of this exercise is to get in touch with the Reference Monitor and Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) one of the oldest and most popular Linux Security Module (LSM) to implement Reference Monitors for the Linux operating system. 

In the first section we will discuss the background and history of \hyperref[selinux]{SELinux}. In the second section we will explain the basic concepts of SELinux. The third section will describe how you could use SELinux concepts practically and the last section discusses how to implement a Reference Monitor.

\section{History and Background}
\label{History}
In this section we will give you a brief background and history of \hyperref[selinux]{SELinux}. SELinux was originally a development project from the National Security Agency (NSA) which was implemented as a Flask operating system security architecture (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security-Enhanced_Linux). The Flask architecture implements Mandatory Access Control (MAC) and focuses on the concept of least privilege.

\subsection{License}
In December 2000 SELinux was released by the NSA as a general access software product with the source code distributed under a GPL license. Since then it is still under the GNU GPL license available.

\subsection{Who are the SELinux contributors?}
The key concept underlying the SELinux based on several earlier projects by NSA who is also the main contributor. Other significant contributors include \textit{Red Hat}, \textit{Network Associates}, \textit{Secure Computing Corporation}, \textit{Tresys Technology}, and \textit{Trusted Computer Solutions}.

\subsection{Who is in charge of SELinux?}
As we mentioned earlier SELinux was originally developed by the NSA and Red Hat, but today Red Hat is mainly in charge of SELinux.

\section{Basic Concepts of SELinux}
In the following we will discuss the basic concepts of SELinux and especially introduce concepts of \textit{Policy}, \textit{Labels} and \textit{Modes}.

\subsection{SELinux Policy}
SELinux follows the model of least-privilege that means that by default everything is denied and only policies give each element of the system access required to its function. SELinux allows different policies to be written that are interchangeable.
SELinux policy is a set of rules that guide the SELinux security engine by defining some types for file objects and domains for processes. Types and domains are equivalent with the difference that types are used to apply to objects while domains apply to processes. In order to limit entering the domain SElinux policy uses \textit{roles} and these roles are specified by user identities which can be attained to the roles. The default policy in Fedora is the so called \textit{target} policy which targets and restricts selected system processes.

\subsection{SELinux Labels}
\label{sec:labels}

SELinux labels are mostly stored as extended attributes. But you have to be careful this is not standard, because some file systems do not support extended attributes. In these cases, all files on the file system get assigned the same context, usually provided through the mount option of the file system. On systems running SELinux, all processes and files are labelled in a way that represents security-relevant information which is called the SELinux \textit{context}. E.g. by running the command \texttt{ls -Z} the information of a certain file will be printed.

\subsection{SELinux Modes}
SELinux provides three basic modes of operation:
\begin{itemize}
   \item \textbf{Enforcing} - is the installation default mode which enforces the SELinux security policy on the system, denying access and logging actions.
   \item \textbf{Permissive} - this mode enables SELinux but will not enforce the security policy, only warn and log actions. This mode is also very helpful for troubleshooting SELinux issues.
   \item \textbf{Disabled} - in this mode SELinux is turned off.
\end{itemize}

The SELinux Management UI enables to view the SELinux mode and make changes possible. From the command line the GUI is available by running \texttt{system-config-selinux}.

\section{Using SELinux}
After we finished the theoretical part of basic concepts of SELinux we come to a more practical view on SELinux by simply using it.
\subsection{Using \texttt{sestatus}}
First of all we start with the \textit{status}. This can be done by printing the status of SELinux on the running system using \texttt{sestatus}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, caption={sestatus ouput}, captionpos=b, label=lsfileattr]
SELinux status:									enabled
SELinuxfs mount: 								/sys/fs/selinux
SELinux root directory: 				/etc/selinux
Loaded policy name: 						targeted
Current mode: 									enforcing
Mode from config file: 					enforcing
Policy MLS status:							enabled
Policy deniy_unknown status: 		allowed
Max kernel policy version: 			30
\end{lstlisting}

The command displays data whether SELinux is enabled, disabled, the loaded policy and whether it is in enforcing or permissive mode (we will describe in later section what that means). It can also be used to display the security context of files and processes listed in the /etc/sestatus.conf file. In this case SELinux is \textbf{enabled}, SELinux is mounted at
\texttt{/sys/fs/selinux}, the root directory of SELinux is \texttt{/etc/selinux}, the default policy name is \texttt{targeted} and the current mode is \texttt{enforcing} the same as from config file, Multi Level Security protection is enabled, the state for unknown permissions is allowed which means everything is allowed to perform this action and the system support a maximum version of 30 that will also support loading policy modules of a lower binary version.

\subsection{Starting the Webserver}
Next we start the webserver by using the command \texttt{sudo systemctl start httpd}. If you are not sure whether the webserver is running or not you can simply check it by \texttt{systemctl status httpd}.
After the webserver started we would like to see what the server actually serves when calling the index.html file: \texttt{curl http://localhost/index.html}. In our case this command prints out:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, caption={SELinux index.html output}, captionpos=b, label=lsfileattr]
"Security = Access Control"
\end{lstlisting}
Which is basically the content of \texttt{index.html}.

As mentioned in the section about \hyperref[sec:labels]{labels} we can get attributes and detail information from a file by running \texttt{ls -lZ}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, caption={SELinux context of index.html}, captionpos=b, label=lsfileattr]
total 4
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root unconfined_u:object_r:httpd_sys_content_t:s0 26 May  3 15:32 /var/www/html/index.html
\end{lstlisting}
When we execute \texttt{ls -lZ} we get the security context of the file /var/www/html/index.html. In addition to the standard file permissions and ownership, we can see the SELinux security context fields: unconfined\textunderscore u:object\textunderscore r:httpd\textunderscore sys\textunderscore content\textunderscore t:s0. The scheme is user:role:type:mls which means in that case that the user is unconfined logged in, the role is object and the type is \texttt{httpd\textunderscore sys\textunderscore content}. The MLS has a low security level (s0), associated with no compartments.

In the next task we change the type label of the file to \texttt{samba\textunderscore share\textunderscore t} using \texttt{chcon}. After we are trying to retrieve the file again we get the following output:
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=left, numberstyle=\small, numbersep=8pt, xleftmargin=1.5em, framexleftmargin=1.5em,language=HTML, caption={index.html output access permission denied}, captionpos=b, label=lsfileattr]
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
<html>
	<head>
		<title>403 Forbidden</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Forbidden</h1>
		<p>You don't have permission to access /index.html on this server.<br /> </p>
	</body>
</html>
\end{lstlisting}

This means we have no permission to access that file. 
But why did the permission changed and why do we have no permission rights? When using \texttt{chcon}, users provide all or part of the SELinux context to change. An incorrect file type causes of SELinux denying access which is why we get the error message from above.

\subsection{The \texttt{audit.log} File}
After we performed some actions on our SELinux access decisions are logged by \textit{auditd} to /var/log/audit/audit.log. Locating the log message of the previous access decision gives us:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, caption={Access decision from audit.log file.}, captionpos=b, label=lsfileattr]
type=AVC msg=audit(1494689834.117:338): avc:  denied  { getattr } for  pid=2980 comm="httpd" path="/var/www/html/index.html" dev="dm-0" ino=1180274 scontext=system_u:system_r:httpd_t:s0 tcontext=unconfined_u:object_r:samba_share_t:s0 tclass=file permissive=0
\end{lstlisting}

   \begin{tabular}{ | l | l | p{5cm} |}
   \hline
    Log part & Name & Description \\ \hline
   type=AVC & Log type &  Only in the audit.log file; it informs the user what kind of audit log type this is. So in our case, it is an AVC log entry. \\ \hline
   msg=audit(1363289005.532:184) & Timestamp &  Timestamp in seconds since epoch.\\ \hline
   avc: & Log type  &Informs the user what kind of log entry this is. In this case, an AVC log entry. \\ \hline
   denied & State & What SELinux did, which can be either denied or granted. Note that, if SELinux is in permissive mode (we'll talk about this later), then it will still log as denied even though it was allowed. \\ \hline
   {{getattr}} & Permission & The permission that was requested / executed. In this case, it is a read operation. Sometimes the permission contains a set (like { read write } but in most cases, it is a single permission request). \\ \hline
   for pid=2980 & Process PID & The process identifier of the process that took the action (in this case, tried to read) \\\hline
   comm = httpad& Process cmd & The process command \\ \hline
   dev = dm-0 & Device & Device on which the target resides (in case of a file or file system). \\ \hline
   ino=1180274 & Inode number & The inode number of the target file. \\ \hline
   scontext& Source context & The security context of the process (the domain) \\ \hline
   tcontext & Target context & The security context of the target resource (in this case the file) \\ \hline
   tclass & Target class & The class of the target. We have seen file already, and dir shouldn't surprise you either. SELinux supports a whole lot of classes, which we will describe later. \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
   \\[10pt]
%\caption{SELinux permission denial details. Disecting the AVC denial.}
Because avc:denied appears in the message we conclude that SELinux denied the access.
We get a corresponding entry in the \textit{system's journal} by \texttt{journalctl}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
~$ journalctl 
\end{lstlisting}
The oldest entries will be up top, where we get the corresponding entry:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, caption={Output from \ file.}, captionpos=b, label=lst:journal,]

\section{SELinux as Reference Monitor}
 In the lecture were three fundamental requirements introduced that a Reference Monitor implementation has to fulfill (c.f. Lecture 1, Slide 30):
 \begin{enumerate}
\item Evaluable - small enough to be subject to analysis 
\item Always invoked - no alterative access method 
\item Tamper-proof - mechanism cannot be altered
\end{enumerate}
Furthermore, the extended Reference Monitor concepts have been introduced (c.f. Lecture 1, Slide 31), i.e. \textit{Authorization Database}, \textit{Monitor Interface} and \textit{Audit Trails}.

The Linux operating system is a complete reimplementation of the POSIX interface. The LSM framework defines such a reference monitor interface for Linux behind which a variety of reference monitor implementations are possible. 
LSM inserts hooks (upcalls to the module) at every point in the kernel where a user-level system call is about to result in access to an internal kernel object such as inodes and task control blocks. Fundamentally, the LSM hooks correspond to LSM authorization queries with the detail that the LSM interface must also include LSM hooks for other LSM tasks, such as labeling, transition, and maintenance of labels. Therefore is LSM hook the counterpart of the Reference Monitor Interface. The LSM labels are implemented as Authorization Databases and auditd and the \texttt{sealert} command can be mapped to Audit Trails. 

Because SELinux is one of the oldest and most popular Linux Security Module (LSM), to implement Reference Monitors for the Linux operating system and provides all the concepts of a Reference it complies with the Reference Monitor requirements.

\section{Discussion and Conclusion}
SELinux is a mandatory access control (MAC) security mechanism implemented in the kernel. It is a comprehensive Linux Security Module that goal is tamperproofing of system’s trusted computing base and therefore it implements Reference Monitors for the Linux operating system. It provides concepts i.e. \textit{Authorization Database} by labels, \textit{Monitor Interface} hooks and \textit{Audit Trails} by commands as \texttt{sealert}.
